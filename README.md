- https://graphql.org/blog/graphql-a-query-language/

  A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client.

### REST
 - https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/
#### Overfetching
 - client downloads more information than is actually required in the app
 
#### Underfetching
 - endpoint doesnâ€™t provide enough of the required information
 - it needs to make one additional request per element to fetch the required data
 
### Pros and Cons
- https://stablekernel.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-graphql/

   :thumbsup:
    - clients have the ability to dictate exactly what they need from the server, and receive that data in a predictable way
    - ability to retrieve many resources in a single request 
    - strongly-typed API
    > Every GraphQL service defines a set of types which completely describe the set of possible data you can query on that service. Then, when queries come in, they are validated and executed against that schema
    
   :thumbsdown:
     - queries always return a HTTP status code of `200`
       - If your query is unsuccessful, your response JSON will have a top-level `errors` key with associated error messages and stacktrace
     - lack of built-in caching support
     - complexity
